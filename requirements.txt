#  Python Requirements for a General Machine Learning Project
# ==============================================================================
#
# Installation:
# 1. Create and activate a new virtual environment.
# 2. Run the following command:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# --- PyTorch Installation Note ---
# For GPU (CUDA/MPS) support, it is STRONGLY recommended to install PyTorch
# from the official website first, BEFORE running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
# Visit: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# After installing the correct PyTorch version, you can comment out 'torch',
# 'torchvision', and 'torchaudio' from this file.

# --- Core Deep Learning & Machine Learning Frameworks ---
torch
torchvision
torchaudio
pytorch-lightning         # User requested (PL): High-level interface for PyTorch
scikit-learn              # Essential library for classical machine learning

# --- Experiment Configuration & Tracking ---
hydra-core                # User requested: Framework for elegantly configuring complex applications
wandb                     # A popular tool for experiment tracking and visualization (MLOps)

# --- Data Handling & Numerical Computation ---
numpy                     # Fundamental package for numerical computation
pandas                    # Powerful data structures for data analysis
scipy                     # Library for scientific and technical computing

# --- Data Visualization ---
matplotlib                # Standard library for plotting
seaborn                   # Statistical data visualization based on matplotlib

# --- Image & Data Processing/Augmentation ---
opencv-python-headless    # Computer vision library (headless version avoids GUI dependencies)
Pillow                    # Python Imaging Library (fork)
albumentations            # Fast and flexible library for image augmentations

# --- Hugging Face Ecosystem (State-of-the-art NLP/Vision models) ---
transformers              # Provides thousands of pretrained models
datasets                  # Provides easy access to thousands of datasets
huggingface-hub           # Hub for models, datasets, and demos

# --- Utilities ---
tqdm                      # A fast, extensible progress bar for loops
ipykernel                 # Required to use this virtual environment in Jupyter Notebooks/Lab
python-dotenv             # Reads key-value pairs from a .env file and sets them as environment variables
